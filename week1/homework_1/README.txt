Answers to text questions from Assignment 1:
â€“ To improve speed for this program we can use the fact that there is only one correct result for each individual number. For example, when N = 10, f(N) = 5. This will always be the case regardless of where the '10' falls within the list. Because we know the value 10 has a specific output, 5, we also know that 5 has a specific output. Therefore, by saving previous lists that have already been found, we can append these to future lists to speed up the creation process without having to pull the odd and even functions each time.
